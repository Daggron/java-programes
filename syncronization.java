/* synchronization is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource
 *
  * SYnchronization is a btter option where we want only one thread to access shared resources
  * advantages of synchronization
  * to prevent thread interfernce
  * to prevent consistency problems
  *
  *
  * synchronization is of two types;-
  * thread Synchronization and process synchronization
  *
  *
  * Thread Synchrnization is further classfied into two types
  * 1>Mutual Exclusive
  * 2>InterThread Communication
  *
  *
  * Mutual Exclusion could also be performed in 3 ways
  *
  * By sychronization method by synchronization block
  * 3 Static synchronization
